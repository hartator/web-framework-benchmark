# web-framework-benchmark

## Objectives

Getting a somewhat accurate benchmarking of modern web frameworks is hard. We'll try to mimic a real world application and at the same time to remain simple. We'll iterate to 1,000 included - adding numbers ony by one to force iteration and aggregation of a result - and return the full array as a JSON response. That will allow us to test iterations, JSON serialization and medium sized response. 

## Results
